##  Description

Capshot: The Digital Time Capsule for Sports Fans
Capshot is a digital time capsule application that captures unforgettable moments in sports stadiums, creating a unique and immersive spectator experience for sports fans. Our innovative photo booth project allows fans to capture memorable moments with their loved ones and instantly turn them into time capsules that can be enjoyed at future events.

With Capshot, you can take a break from the intensity of the game and relax while capturing a souvenir photo with your friends and family. Our advanced technology then turns your photo into a time capsule, which you can receive a year later on the same date or when the poster of the match you attended is presented again.

Not only is Capshot a keepsake for fans, but it also serves as a powerful marketing tool for sports teams and related brands. By offering this unique spectator experience, sports teams can engage with their fans in a more personal and meaningful way.

We are excited to bring Capshot to sporting events around the world and provide sports fans with a truly unforgettable experience. Join us in creating memories that will last a lifetime!
